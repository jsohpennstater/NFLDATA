# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# PLAYER SEED DATA
# player_data = File.read("./public/NFLjson/nflgame/players.json")
# sorted_player_data = JSON.parse(player_data)
#
# sorted_player_data.each do |player_key, player_data|
#   Player.create(
#     gsis: player_data["gsis_id"],
#     first_name: player_data["first_name"],
#     last_name: player_data["last_name"],
#     birthdate: player_data["birthdate"],
#     years_pro: player_data["years_pro"],
